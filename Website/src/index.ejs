        <h2>Why BlurHash?</h2>
        <h3>Why would you want this?</h3>
        <p>
          Does your designer cry every time you load their beautifully designed screen, and it is
          full of empty boxes because all the images have not loaded yet? Does your database
          engineer cry when you want to solve this by trying to cram little thumbnail images into
          your data to show as placeholders?

    <div class="section how-it-works">
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        In short, BlurHash takes an image, and gives you a short string (only 20-30 characters!)
        that represents the placeholder for this image. You do this on the backend of your service,
        and store the string along with the image. When you send data to your client, you send both
        the URL to the image, and the BlurHash string. Your client then takes the string, and
        decodes it into an image that it shows while the real image is loading over the network. The
        string is short enough that it comfortably fits into whatever data format you use. For
        instance, it can easily be added as a field in a JSON object.
      </p>

        The same exported data can be used on all platforms. Get the BlurHash library for your
        platform of choice.
